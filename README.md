## PACE Framework for Data Analytics Projects

The "PACE Framework" section introduces a structured approach for conducting data analytics projects. PACE stands for Plan, Prepare for Success, Analyze, and Execute, and it outlines key questions to consider during each stage of your project. Following this framework will help you define project goals, collaborate with stakeholders effectively, and present your findings with impact and clarity.



## Top Techniques

The "Top Techniques" section presents a table containing various data science tasks and the techniques used to address them. From missing value imputation to model evaluation and performance metrics, each technique is accompanied by explanatory code snippets where applicable. Whether you are handling outliers, scaling features, or performing dimensionality reduction, these methods will assist you in achieving robust data analysis and modeling.
